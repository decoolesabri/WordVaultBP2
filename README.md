## Usage Guide
When you open the application, you will first see the **login page**. Here, you can create an account by choosing a **username and password**. If you already have an account, simply enter your credentials to log in.

Once logged in, you will be directed to the **homepage**, where you can navigate to:
- The **Add Page** – to add a new word to your vocabulary.
- The **List Page** – to view all the words you have saved.

On the **List Page**, you can:
- Open the **Add Page** to add new words.
- **Update** an existing word.
- **Delete** a word from your list.

## Roadmap
In the future, I would like to implement the following improvements:
- **Detailed explanations of word categories** in Spanish, making it easier to determine which category a word belongs to.
- **Additional animations** for a smoother and more engaging user experience.
- **Improved login system** that indicates whether you've logged in with an existing account or a new one.
- **Enhanced design of the List Page**, giving it a more professional appearance.
