## Usage Guide
When you open the application, you will first see the **login page**. Here, you can create an account by choosing a **unique username and a secure password**. If you already have an account, simply enter your credentials to log in.

Once logged in, you will be directed to the **homepage**, where you can navigate to:
- The **Add Page** – to add a new word along with its translation and an optional note.
- The **List Page** – to view and manage all the words you have saved.

On the **List Page**, you can:
- Open the **Add Page** to quickly insert new words into your vocabulary list.
- **Update** an existing word by modifying its translation or adding/editing a note for better context.
- **Delete** a word from your list if you no longer need it or added it by mistake.

Using my application helps you **store** your newly learned words and sentences while documenting your learning journey. This keeps the process **organized** and prevents confusion. Now, you can enjoy your Spanish learning journey without worrying about losing any of your progress!

## Communication with stakeholders
Stakeholders have been kept informed about the project through analysis, advisory reports, design, and realisation. These documents were shared with them via Brightspace, where they provided feedback.

The realisation process was primarily documented on GitHub. By frequently committing changes to the repository, stakeholders could clearly track the project's progress and development journey.

## Evaluation
The effectiveness of the application is evaluated based on unit tests and user feedback. After a certain period of time, a feedback round can be conducted with users.

## Roadmap
In the future, I would like to implement the following improvements:
- **Detailed explanations of word categories** in Spanish, making it easier to determine which category a word belongs to. I want to add this before June 2025.
- **Improved login system** that indicates whether you've logged in with an existing account or a new one. I aim to have this implemented before autumn 2025.
- **Additional animations** for a smoother and more engaging user experience. This isn't a top priority, but I want this to be done within a year.
- **Enhanced design of the List Page**, giving it a more professional appearance. I want to add this improvement before 2026.
- **Feedback round with users**, I plan to conduct this after 3 months, around July.

Some of these improvements are more important than others, the most important ones are at the **top** of the list.
